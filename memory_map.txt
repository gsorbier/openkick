The top-level categories come from "The Amiga 3000+ System Specification" which
describes a superset of the Amiga memory map.

"Pandora" became AGA, whereas the A3000+ was cost-reduced and turned into the
A4000.

000000- Standard Chip RAM
==========

Conventional Amigas have 256kiB-2MiB of Chip RAM. Incomplete address decoding
can occur, e.g. a machine that nominally has 1MiB of Chip RAM may have an alias
at 100000. Address decoding gets a bit odd if one takes a 512kiB "trapdoor"
memory expansion intended for an A500 and inserts it into an A500+, but it
works fine in that the OS correctly detects 1.5MiB of Chip RAM and no Ranger
RAM.

UAE supports up to 8MiB of Chip RAM by extending it into the Zorro II area and
forbidding Zorro II RAM. Unlike the approach taken by Pandora, this also works
on 24 bit machines.

200000- Zorro II Memory Expansion
900000- Zorro II I/O Expansion
==========

The 900000 is probably a typo as 8MiB Zorro II RAM cards normally map to
200000-9fffff.

On the A600/A1200, "credit card memory" will appear at 600000-9fffff.

b80000- Low I/O Registers
==========

a00000-a1ffff "Credit Card Attributes" (A1200)
a20000-a3ffff "Credit Card I/O" (A1200)
a40000-a5ffff "Credit Card Bits (similar-CDTV)" (A1200)
a60000-a7ffff "PC I/O" (A1200)
a80000-b7ffff "System ROM selected" (A1200)
b80000-beffff Reserved for CDTV.
bf0000-bfffff CIA Ports and Timers

c00000- "Ranger" RAM
c80000- RESERVED
d80000- High I/O Registers
==========

The Amiga's famous custom chips nominally appear at dff000 upwards, however
incomplete decoding means they will appear throughout this range unless
shadowed by other hardware or RAM. This means that RAM may extend upwards from
c00000 until it starts hiding important hardware. "1.8MB" RAM cards were
commercially available. Devious RAM tests are necessary to avoid poking
hardware.

The "Ranger" moniker is Commodore's. Users more commonly called it "Slow RAM"
because the usual implementation was to have the DRAM chips refreshed by Agnus
and be bus-contended with Chip RAM accesses.

d80000-d8ffff "SPARE chip select"
d90000-d9ffff "ARCNET chip select"
da0000-da3fff IDE drive (A1200)
da4000-da4fff IDE reserved (A1200)
da8000-daffff Credit Card and IDE configregisters (A1200)
db0000-dbffff "Not used (reserved for external IDE)" (A1200)
dc0000-dcffff real-time clock (if fitted)
dd0000-ddffff RESERVED for DMA controller
de0000-deffff A3000 "motherboard resources" (if fitted)
df0000-dfffff AMIGA Chips

The A3000+ is documented as having a COM20020 chip for RS-485 networking at
d900xx; it's not ARCNET though. In the ddxxxx range, the A3000+ places its
WD33C93 SCSI controller appears at dd00[0-4]x (as apparently does a more or
less compatible chip in the the A3000.) and a DSP3210 coprocessor and SSPB
hardware at dd005x. The A3000+'s Gary+ appears at de0xxx and de1xxx.

e00000- Low ROM
==========

This likely never appeared in real hardware.

UAE supports placing a ROM in this space. It is used by e.g. m68k AROS.

e80000- Zorro II I/O & Configuration
==========

Zorro II cards initially appear at e80000 and are then told to map
themselves at new addresses based on their reported size. 64kiB cards are
placed from e90000 onwards. RAM boards are placed from 200000 onwards.

Presumably middling-sized I/O cards are placed in the 1.5MiB space from a00000
onwards?

f00000- Diagnostic ROM
f80000- High ROM
==========

The conventional 512kiB Kickstart ROM appears at f80000. 256kiB ROMs are
incompletely decoded and appear twice in that range, but have a nominal address
of fc0000.

Kickstart 1.2 looks for Kickstart-like ROMs at f00000 and will branch there in
the early startup code. (There's a check to prevent an infinite loop if the ROM
is incompletely decoded.) This seems to relate to a diagnostic card, which was
not generally available. Kickstart also adds any RomTags that appear in this
area (assuming that the diagnostic ROM lets it get that far.) UAE hooks in via
this diagnostic mechanism.

0100'0000- Pandora Chip RAM
0200'0000- (unlabelled)
==========

This likely never appeared in real hardware.

The "Pandora Chip RAM" space was intended to support up to 16MiB of Chip RAM,
and the A3000+ design supported 8MiB although Alice still only supported 2MiB.
The documentation notes that Chip RAM above the 2MiB mark would appear at
0120'0000 onwards, although it's unclear if an alias of the first 2MiB appears
at 0100'0000. It's rather unlikely for it to *only* be at 0100'0000 because
there needs to be RAM at address 4.

The space from 03c0'0000 was intended for a 4MiB ROM. The Low/High ROMs would
be aliased at 03e0'0000 and 03f8'0000 respectively.

0400'0000- RESERVED / Motherboard Fast RAM
==========

The A4000 supports up to 16MiB of motherboard RAM, which grows downwards from
07ff'ffff, or 077f'ffff if Kickstart shadowing was enabled with the A3640's
MapROM hardware. (The A3000 is probably identical.)

Under UAE, the full 64MiB may be enabled.

0800'0000- Coprocessor Slot Expansion
==========

1000'0000- Zorro III Expansion
8000'0000- RESERVED
==========

It seems likely that the upper address limit of 8000'0000 on Zorro III cards is
due to the reasonable assumption that large boards are memory, and because
exec.library/AllocEntry uses bit 31 of addresses to indicate failure, this
effectively limits all system RAM to below the 2GiB mark.

If one configures FS-UAE with 1GiB of ZIII RAM and a ZIII UAEGFX board, the
former will be placed at 0400'0000 and the latter at 8000'0000, apparently
without ill effect.

So it seems that I/O boards -- even graphics cards that expose their video RAM
to the CPU -- can have high-bit-set addresses at least as far as AmigaOS cares.
There may be a hardware limitation on shipping machines.

ff00'0000- Zorro III Configuration Unit
ff01'0000- RESERVED
==========

The reserved space exists because Zorro III cards are permitted to decode just
A24-A31 for their configuration space.
